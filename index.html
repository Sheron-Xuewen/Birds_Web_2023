                    <h3>Art and Nature's Rhythm</h3>
                    <p>The seal's position is designed with reference to the Solar Terms Chart. The round eye of birds metaphorizes the sun, while seals in various positions metaphorize the position of the earth relative to the sun at this solar term. The design symbolized the flow of different solar terms and shows the cycle of time and the change of seasons.<br><br>
                        The single eye of the bird is the core of the picture. Its gaze was firmly fixed on the surrounding red seals just like sunlight shining on the earth. The bird's gaze not only guides the viewer's gaze, but also hints at life's desire and sensitivity to light and seasonal changes, as well as the profound connection between life and nature. 
                        I hope that this will subtly integrate the periodicity of solar terms and the harmony of celestial bodies, thereby triggering the audience to think deeply about the laws of nature and the rhythm of life, and reminding people to pay attention to and appreciate the exquisite harmony of nature.

                <h1>Inspired by Bada Shanren</h1>
                <p>My artwork has been influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bada_Shanren" target="_blank">Bada Shanren</a>. I used a single ink color and rough and strong lines to outline the form of birds, capturing their vividness and dynamics. Appropriate white space not only enhances the visual artistic effect of the artwork, but also provides the audience with a space for imagination and thinking.<br><br>
                    Different from the creative mood of Bada Shanren, I convey more of a sense of freedom that is detached from the world and a proud and free spirit that is not afraid of the changes of the seasons. My spirit and pursuit are placed in it, praising the birds that still live tenaciously and beautifully in the changing climate.
